    "### Qualitative or categorical types (non-numeric types)\n",
    "1. Nominal data: pure labels without inherent order (no label is intrinsically greater or less than any other)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Quantitative or numeric types\n",
    "3. Interval data: numeric values where absolute differences are meaningful (addition and subtraction operations can be made)\n",
